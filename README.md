# Node.js and React User Form Application

This is a simple user form application built using Node.js and React.js. It allows users to submit their details and performs basic validation on the form fields. The backend is implemented using Node.js and Express.js, while the frontend is built with React.js.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd node-react-user-form
   ```

3. Navigate to the server directory:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```


4. Install the dependencies for the backend:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. Navigate to the client directory:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

6. Install the dependencies for the frontend:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

7. Go back to the project root directory:

   ```bash
   cd ..
   ```

8. Start the development server for both the backend and frontend:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the Node.js backend server and the React frontend development server concurrently.

9. Open your web browser and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the application.

## Usage

- Fill in the user form with the required details: name, email, date of birth, and phone number.
- Submit the form by pressing the "Submit" button.
- Basic front-end validation will be performed on the name, email, and date of birth fields.
- The phone number validation happens at the backend.
- If the form submission is successful, a success message will be displayed.
- The form data will be saved (add your own implementation here) and an email will be sent (add your own implementation here).
